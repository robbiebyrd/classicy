00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:17,380
It was easy then to tell right from wrong, easy then to tell weak from strong, when a man should stand and fight, or just go along.

2
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,020
But today there is no day or night

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,480
Today there is no dark or light

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,980
Today there is no black or white

5
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,120
Only shades of grey

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,120
I remember when the answers seemed so clear

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,260
We had never lived without or tasted fear

8
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,840
It was easier than to tell truth from lies

9
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,180
Selling out from compromise

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,340
Who to love and who to hate

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,399
The foolish from the wise

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,100
But today there is no day or night

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,600
Today there is no dark or light

14
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,420
Today there is no black or white

15
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,760
Only shades of gray

16
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,120
guitar solo
